👋 Hi, I'm Yugesh
Full-stack & Mobile Developer • Geospatial Data Visualization • 2nd Year CS @ MIT

I build responsive web applications and cross-platform mobile apps. Most of my projects are full-stack or have real-world focus, often developed under deadlines and hackathon constraints.

I'm currently focused on **Advanced Flutter Mobile Development**, **Geospatial Visualization Systems**, and **Full-Stack Architecture**.

Each project includes:
- Clean, maintainable code with architecture explanations
- Responsive design for mobile-first experiences
- Real database integration and API connectivity
- Honest scope (MVPs and production-ready systems)

🎯 Current Focus
- Advanced Flutter animations and map integrations
- Full-stack disaster management and alerting systems
- Geospatial data visualization with interactive maps
- Building systems that handle real-world constraints
- Writing cleaner, more scalable code

How I Approach Development
> I care more about understanding the system than chasing tools. If it works, is maintainable, and solves a real problem—it's worth building. Everything else is secondary.

I believe in:
- Writing code that's easy to understand and modify
- Building systems that scale with user needs
- Using the right tool for the job, not the trending one
- Delivering MVPs first, then iterating based on feedback
- Documenting my work for future reference
