## Overview

I design and build **production-oriented full-stack systems and cross-platform mobile applications** with a strong focus on **real-world constraints, geospatial intelligence, and clean architecture**.

Most of my work is developed under **hackathon timelines or deployment-driven deadlines**, where delivery speed, correctness, and maintainability are non-negotiable.  
These are not demo projects—they are **end-to-end systems** spanning frontend, backend, databases, APIs, maps, and deployment.

---

## Current Focus

- Advanced **Flutter** mobile development (animations, maps, performance)
- **Geospatial visualization systems** with real-time data
- Scalable **full-stack architecture**
- Building reliable MVPs and evolving them into production systems

---

## Engineering Philosophy

I care more about **understanding systems** than chasing tools.

If a solution is:
- reliable,
- maintainable,
- and solves a real problem,

then it is worth building.

### I strongly believe in:
- Writing code that is easy to read, debug, and extend
- Designing systems that scale with real usage
- Choosing tools based on suitability, not trends
- Shipping MVPs early and iterating with intent
- Documenting decisions for long-term clarity
